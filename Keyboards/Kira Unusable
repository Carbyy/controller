I was trying to set my default color profile going back and forth between loading and saving and
now my keyboard is stuck in a loop that is unknown to myself. None of the LED's will turn on, nor
can I use it anymore. I just keeps pinging windows like it's trying to make an action.

If anyone has any advice on how to fix this I would greatly appreciate it, as I really would like
to be able to use my Kira again.
